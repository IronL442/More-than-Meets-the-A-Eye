## Using Data Augmentation to Generate Salient Images

### Overview  
This seminar explores how **data augmentation** and **deep learning–based saliency prediction models** can be used to **generate, modify, or enhance images** so they better align with **human visual attention patterns**.  
The focus is on understanding how models predict saliency, how artificial saliency maps compare to human fixation data, and how image transformations influence attention.

---

### Objectives
- **Investigate pixel-wise saliency prediction models**  
  (e.g., DeepGaze, SalGAN, SAM, MLNet)
- **Generate artificial saliency maps** using existing models  
  and validate them against human eye-tracking data
- **Apply and adapt image augmentation techniques**  
  to study their impact on predicted saliency
- **Identify potentials for social media analytics**,  
  such as optimizing an image’s “attention pull”

---

### Approach
1. **Literature Review**  
   - Focus on traditional pixel-wise saliency prediction models  
   - Exclude object-level saliency ranking (SRD) unless used for context  

2. **Model-Based Generation**  
   - Generate synthetic saliency maps using established models  
   - Compare predictions with empirical fixation data  

3. **Augmentation Experiments**  
   - Apply traditional and saliency-aware augmentations  
   - Analyze how transformations affect predicted saliency  

4. **Application Insight**  
   - Discuss how saliency modeling supports  
     attention optimization in social media contexts

### Expected Outcomes
- A **synthetic saliency dataset** generated via existing models  
- An **evaluation** comparing model-based predictions to human fixation data  
- Insights into **how augmentation influences saliency distribution**  
- Guidance on **optimizing images for attention** in applied scenarios
